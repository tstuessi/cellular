# Cellular

A totalistic 1D cellular automaton simulator, designed for [COSC 420](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~mclennan/Classes/420/) at UTK. 
Note: the scripts in main\_scripts were written quickly and for an express purpose. They are not intended to be modular, so use and edit at your own risk.

`python main.py`
